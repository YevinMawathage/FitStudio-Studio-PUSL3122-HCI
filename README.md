# FitSpace-Studio: Interactive Room Design Platform

## Module Name: PUSL3122 HCI, Computer Graphics, and Visualisation
## FurnitureFit is a desktop application aimed at transforming the customer and designer collaboration experience in the furniture designing industry. This tool enables the visualization of how selected furniture pieces, like chairs and tables, fit within a customer's space, considering the room's size, color schemes, and shape. It's designed to enhance the in-store experience by offering functional and aesthetic compatibility assessments of furniture in any given space.


# Overview:
## FitSpace-Studio is an interactive platform designed to help users create, manage, and visualize custom room layouts. With real-time 3D visualizations, users can select, place, and adjust furniture in a virtual room environment. It integrates computer graphics and HCI principles to provide a seamless design experience.

### Key Features

- **Room Design**: Create custom room layouts by adjusting room dimensions and placing furniture.
- **3D Visualization**: Real-time rendering of the room design with smooth 3D graphics.
- **Furniture Catalogue**: Browse and select furniture items to place in the room.
- **User Management**: ASecure login, sign-up, and profile management using SQLite database.
- **Save & Manage Designs**: Save room designs and edit them later.
- **Help & Tutorials**: Access useful guides for creating and managing room designs.

## Technologies Used

This project incorporates a variety of technologies to provide a robust and efficient design experience. Here's a breakdown of the key technologies used:

- **Java Swing**: Utilized for the user interface, this tool ensures a smooth and responsive design experience, enabling intuitive interaction with the application's features.

- **JOGL (Java Binding for the OpenGL API)**: This binding allows the application to utilize OpenGL for rendering 3D graphics. It's instrumental in visualizing furniture and room layouts in three dimensions, providing a realistic view of design concepts.

- **OpenGL**: A powerful, low-level graphics API renowned for its efficiency and quality in 3D visualization. It works in conjunction with JOGL and JOGLE for rendering detailed and complex design elements, making it a cornerstone for the applicationâ€™s visual capabilities.

- **LWJGL**: (Lightweight Java Game Library): This is a high-performance library that provides a Java interface to OpenGL, Vulkan, and other graphics APIs. LWJGL is essential for creating sophisticated visual effects and ensuring the application can handle complex 3D graphics with ease.

- **FBX**: A popular, adaptable file format used to store 3D animations, models, and scenes. Incorporating FBX support allows for greater flexibility in importing and exporting 3D content, enhancing the application's interoperability with various design tools and platforms.

- **SQL**: At the core of the application's data management system is SQL, a standard language for managing and manipulating databases. It is used extensively to store, retrieve, and manage design data, ensuring that user creations are saved and can be modified or reused in future projects.

Each of these technologies plays a vital role in the functionality and performance of the application, providing a seamless and productive design environment.
