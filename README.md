FitSpace-Studio
Module Name: PUSL3122 HCI, Computer Graphics, and Visualisation
Project Name: FitSpace-Studio

FitSpace-Studio is an interactive design platform where users can create, manage, and customize furniture layouts for their spaces. The application leverages modern graphics libraries and frameworks to offer real-time 3D visualizations and interactive design experiences for users.

Features:
Design Room Layout: Users can create customized room designs by adjusting the dimensions and placing furniture pieces interactively in a 3D space.

Furniture Catalogue: Browse and select various furniture items to place in the room.

Database Integration: Store and manage designs and user profiles using SQLite.

Login & User Management: Secure user login and profile management.

Help & Tutorials: Access useful tips and guides on how to use the platform effectively.

Libraries Used:
LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library): Used for creating high-performance 3D graphics and handling user input.

JOGL (Java OpenGL): Provides access to OpenGL graphics for rendering.

FLATLAF: A modern look-and-feel for Java Swing applications.

SQLite: For managing persistent data storage, including user information and design details.

Jar Files: Includes additional utilities for the project.

This project demonstrates the integration of human-computer interaction (HCI), computer graphics, and visualization techniques to build an intuitive and immersive design experience.
